# Sentence Similarity Analysis

This project is centered around the assessment of sentence similarity utilizing cutting-edge Sentence Transformer models. The objective is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different models in capturing semantic similarity between a provided query and a collection of passages. The analysis involves calculating similarity scores, normalizing distances, and employing TOPSIS analysis to rank models based on various criteria.
